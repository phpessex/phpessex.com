                    <p>The PHP Essex User Group has been set up as a way for like-minded developers to get to know each
                        other, network and share our knowledge.</p>

                    <p>Our monthly meets are informal and we welcome developers of any skill level, from
                        beginners to experts, we'd love to meet you!<p>

                    <p>To start with our meetups will be social gatherings but as the group grows we will look to
                        hold talks and presentations in addition to the general chit chat and socialising.

                    <p>If you live in or around Essex, or are passing through, please come and join us for drink and a
                        chat.

                    <p>Our goal is to emulate the success of other PHP user groups and build a PHP community in Essex.</p>

                    <p>You'll find all the information you need for our upcoming meetups here or on the
                        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PHP-Essex">PHP Essex Meetup page</a>.</p>
